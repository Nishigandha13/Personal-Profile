<h2 style="margin-top:7%;">Life experience:ðŸ¥²</h2>           
<h4><p> 1.<u>Travelling first time alone:</u><br>
    It was a wonderfull experienced for me.It teaches me many important life skills that may seem like "soft" skills,but are very important to understand life.It allows me to spend time with myself.First and foremost,travel is the antidote to bigotry.</p>
<p>2.<u>First Internship:</u><br>
    It was a virtual internship related to soft skills.It gives me a spark in technical world.It was my entrypoint to enter into the tech world.I get to know how these skills helps to transfer into skillable and smart developer.</p> 
<p>3.<u>Volunteering:</u><br>
    Another great experience is volunteering for Non-profit organisation.I learned that how I care about something other than myself and are dedicated to make a difference beyond profit.It also teaches me that be open-minded about where you may volunteer your time too as it's not just about the traditional course of aged care or community groups-even organizations like TEDX are run by volunteers and speak to your passions and ability to work as a team to achieve a common goal.</p>
<p>4.<u>Mentoring Program:</u><br>
    Mentoring a programmed like Youth Off The Streets was unforgottable experienced.That experinced was immensely rewarding to help me see things from different perspective and help others by sharing my own experience.</p>
<p>5.<u>Attend webinars,workshop:</u><br>
    Speaking of networking,attending webinars,workshop in our field is an excellent way to meet people around the world.It teaches me how to connect to people and learn from them.</p>
